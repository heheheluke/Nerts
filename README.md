An implementation of the card game Nerts in the functinal programming language OCaml. (Originally a semester-long final project for the CS3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures course at Cornell University)

For instructions on how to play the game, here's a nice link to describes the rules: https://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html

For instructions on how to run OCaml, the CS3110 course page provides a very concise set of instructions for both OS X and Windows operating systems: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2016fa/install.html

Repo mostly a file dump to save code.
